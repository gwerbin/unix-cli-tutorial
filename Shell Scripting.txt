Shell Scripting

---	Motivation

	Why bother?
	What’s wrong with the GUI?
	What’s an example of shell scripting being better than point-and-click?
	First decide on the motivation for 
		Quantitative Social Scientists to learn it, and then we can set goals

	M1.	Efficiency, expressiveness
		Eg. Efficiency moving file around
			Being a “power user” “chaining” tools
			Rapid “prototyping” (i.e. Looking at raw data)

	M2. Some tools require it
		Eg. Git(Git GUI is horrible), Latex(GUI is okay but still better to understand that it’s just a wrapper for command line)
			Hadoop(no way to bypass shell scripting if you need to get all settings transparent and right, there is still AWS GUI, but not recommended)
			
	M3. Handling extremely large files
		Stream vs. batch processing

	M4. Preprocessing
		…|python…|R>txt

	M5. Reproducibility
		sh files, bat files
		


---	Commands:
		cd, touch, mkdir, echo, ls, ll, chmod, sudo, su, pushd, popd, gloobing(wildcards), alias, control flow + functions, more/less, text editors, package managers, redirection(>,>>,<) , Tr, cut, sed, awk, grep,…
		what is a command line switch
		shell is basically a special interpreter for a special programming language

		basename 
		  removes all leading directory info and specified extensions 
		  e.g. basename /tmp/epi.nii.gz .nii.gz   gives   epi
		dirname 
		  just returns the directory path to the specified file 
		  e.g. dirname /tmp/epi.nii.gz   gives   /tmp
		sort 
		  sorts files (by line) according to alphabetic or numerical order
		which 
		  reports where an executable file can be found 
		  e.g. which flirt   gives   /usr/local/fsl/bin/flirt
		head 
		  prints the first n lines of a file
		tail 
		  prints the last n lines of a file
		touch 
		  creates an empty file
		paste 
		  merges files together (horizontally)



---	Real-world examples:  ***
		Flat text file + “.output” (3 Gigs > 1 Gigs)
		Open it would be so slow
		Crashed excel, load it in SPSS but so damn slow
		Need to do something in R
		head d.output
		pip separated
		wc -l
		some replacement
